# Cloud-Resume-Challenge
Cloud resume challenge repo.
#Finally figured out how to setup the repository and push to it. This contains my initial static page (index.html & css) and the v2 version using grid (in progress). 

#Added title to change the name on the browser tab. 
Modified the original index and stylesheet to include elements from v2. Might keep working with it while I practice using flex on v2.
